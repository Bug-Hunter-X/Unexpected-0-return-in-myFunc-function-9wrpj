This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating an uncommon error: an incorrect early exit condition in a function. The function `myFunc` is designed to add two numbers, but it prematurely returns 0 if either input is 0, even if the other is non-zero. This leads to unexpected behavior. The solution demonstrates the correct logic and explains how to avoid this type of error.
